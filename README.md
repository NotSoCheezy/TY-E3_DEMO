Changelog:

v1.2 5/13/2020:

Yeeted out literally everything from before and modified z2.lv2 instead. This saves a substantial amount of space for those who count their kilobytes. The folder from 1.1 was deemed unnecessary at this time.

v1.1 5/11/2020:

Removed Translations[].txt files and Room_z2_water.wmh as these were found to be against the spirit of preservation and unnecessary, respectively. Placed file in subfolder for sake of cleanliness.

v1.0:

Initial release.
